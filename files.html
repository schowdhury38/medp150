   <p>I wanted this picture to focus on the middle file so I tried my best to have it in focus. I also love how the diagnol of the files naturally draws your eyes to the middle and allows you to seamlessly look along the diagnol. The main edits that I made to this image was to make it brighter since the original image was very dark. I also wanted to create some contrast such that words on the papers stood out since my original picture was quite blurry. I also tried to make the colors as even as possible and I dulled the yellow color of the walls to do this. </p>
