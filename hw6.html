  <h1> Homework #6: In-Lab Vector Emotive Eye </h1>
  <img src="images/eye.png" alt="eye" width="300px">
  <p> I found this assignment to be really fun since I have always loved practicing how to draw eyes. For this assignment, I wanted to create an eye that was crying, so I used brown and blue (two complimentary colors) to achieve this. For my eye, I had a really hard time using the pen on illustrator to create shapes. I wanted more of an irregular shape since eyes aren’t perfect geometric shapes, so I added some of those irregularities with the draw tool. I also wanted to try to create a realistic looking pupil using the blend tool however the pupil didn’t really come out realistically, but it looked super cool, so I kept it in my final eye. I decided to make the eye have tears in it that were just beginning to fall out. I was exactly satisfied with how the final tear looked because I wasn’t able to create a blended look with the blend tool, so I decided to leave it as a solid color with just a lowered opacity. I also almost forgot to add eyelashes!! For my illustration, I first drew the eye at a small scale since I found that it was easier to start with a smaller illustration. After I finished my illustration, I rescaled my drawing so that it filled up most of the artboard. I had to do some small edits to the rescaled drawing since there were some parts of my illustration that were blank that I had to recolor and draw. <br>
