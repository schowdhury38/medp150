  <h1> Homework #10: Interactive Story</h1>
  <p> I love interactive stories. My first interactive story was through a book that I received when I was little from my mother’s workplace. It was so fun to flip through the pages as a chose different pathways for the characters to go through as I progressed through the story. I'll admit that for some of the interactive stories I have played, I might have cheated and changed my choice when I was not satisfied with the ending my character got (especially in Goosebumps). For this assignment, I was really stuck on what I wanted to be making my story about. I went through a bunch of possible stories such as exam day or final day, oversleeping or having a lucid dream so that the ending would be that everything was a dream, and buying a house and its process. I finally decided that I wanted my interactive story to be about how my family and I found our cat last year and the different events that took place the night we found him. For this story, I did not make my own images or use my own pictures that I had of my cat due to time constraints as I did not have the time to find these photographs with the sheer load of finals and exams I had. I used a multitude of free images that I found on Freepik that closely resembled what happened in the story. I might add my own photos later, but that depends on whether I can find the time to do so. I really hope that this story is engaging as I really wanted it to read as a fun mystery story.  <br><br>
