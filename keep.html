  <h1> You keep the kitten! </h1>
  <img src="images/blanket.png" alt="blanket" width="300px">
  <p>You and your family decide to keep the kitten! You take it home and make a makeshift bed for it with a cardboard box and a blanket (thankfully today was not the day to throw out the carboards!). The kitten keeps crying and you realize it must be hungry. You have no food that is safe for kittens (as you find out through a quick Google search. Drats! Why do shows lie that cow milk is fine for cats?), what do you do? </p>
