  <h1> Homework #9: Data Visualization </h1>

  <p> I really enjoyed this project since I love making graphs! For my data, I decided to make a google form focusing on reading. The questions on my form where: what is your favorite genre to read?, how much time do you spend reading?, what is your favorite form of reading?, is your favorite genre to read the same as your favorite genre to watch?, and what is your favorite genre to watch?. For these questions I had multiples choices and only allowed for responders to choose one choice since I wasn’t sure how I could show responders making multiple choices in the same question. This may be why the data was not too accurate to the responders’ true feelings.I was nervous, however, on how many responses I would get since I was not able to spread the survey as far as I wanted to. I was satisfied with how many responses I got since it was not increasing for many days. For my graphs, I struggled with structuring the data; my Illustrator file restarted and deleted multiple times until I figured out how to properly resize my graphs. I also tried my best to make my graphs look pretty. I used a font that looked like it would be used in a fairytale as well as sticking to a brown neutral theme for my colors. I felt that my background was too simple and I wanted to add images of book pages to the backgrounds of my graphs, but I found that it clashes with the data and made it hard to read. Due to this, I left my background plain, however I kind of wished I found another solution to this problem. </p>
