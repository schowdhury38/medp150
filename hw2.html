  <h1> Homework #2: Cropping and Resizing Images & Tonal Range </h1>
  <h3>city outside the bridge.</h3>

<p>This picture depicts the scenery outside the skybridge that leads to the library + East Buidling. I choose this image as it's a scenery that is nostolgic to me. It reminds me of the late classes I would take in my Sophomore year and the time I would take to glance at this scenery at night before I went home. The school would be empty and serene which is very different from how it is usually. The scenery would be decorated with blinding lights from the cars and the Empire State Building. In this image, you can see the reflection from the glass showing some aspects of the hallway, but mostly showing a reflection of the school on the right side of the image. The image doesn't have this in focus as I wanted it to be kind of like taking a breath of air during a busy day. Looking out the window and seeing this beautiful view, giving yourself space to just breathe. </p>

  <h3>files on a wall.</h3>

<p>This image depicts the files on the wall outside of our lab. I find that there is something nostalgic about having files nailed to the wall with papers containing information on them. The practice of hanging things with important imformation on wall has always been something that has caught my eye. Maybe it's because I have also been in a school that does this or maybe it's the nature of a school to do this? I am always reminded of my elementary school when I see files since I would sometimes bring my teacher's attendance sheet to her file for her. Files = school to me. I wanted this picture to focus on the middle file so I tried my best to have it in focus. I also love how the diagnol of the files naturally draws your eyes to the middle and allows you to seamlessly look along the diagnol. </p>
