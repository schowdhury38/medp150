  <p> I find taking photographs to be quite difficult already, so this assignment really upped the challenge for me! I have always been interested in how movies could make such a small place look so big or how they can portray something by just focusing on certain things, so this lesson was really insightful. For this assignment, I knew I had to take a picture of the extra cameras on the table in our lab. I love DSLR cameras, and I wanted to try to emulate those old Tumblr and Pinterest photos that focus on cameras. I took many rounds of photographs as I found that I had not gotten too great of a blurred background, or I had moved my camera when taking both the shallow and deep depth of field photos. I really struggled to get the background to be blurred and to get as much detail as I could of the camera that I was focusing on. I hope that I was able to do at least a decent job for these photos. There is definitely a learning curve for me in this lesson in terms of taking photos. However, I found that using the camera raw filter in Photoshop wasn't too bad since I do have experience editing photos to have this effect.  </p>
