  <p> You put on a jacket on top of your pajamas, and you head out. You're channeling your inner Sherlock Holmes as you decide that you have to get to the bottom of this mysterious sound. You head out to your backyard since your window is closest to it, and you listen. You hear the sound again...and it is a kitten! But you can’t figure out where it is. You recruit your siblings and parents to help you search for the kitten!  </p>
