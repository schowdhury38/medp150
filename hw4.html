  <h1> Homework #4: Photomontage </h1>
  <img src="" alt="cat" width="300px">
  <p> I loved this lesson as I have been making photomontages since I was in high school with my club where I was involved with making posters for events. I also just liked to make photomontages for fun especially during Covid lockdown. I found this lesson to be both fun and interesting as I have never used Photoshop to make photomontages before and the new software took some time to get use to. I found it incredicle that Photoshop can automatically remove the background of images and it can do it quite well (I only had to go back in to remove and add a few details!). I also found the blend modes to be such incredible cheat codes! They can do some many editing steps in just one step!!</p>
