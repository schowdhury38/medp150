  <p> Samiha Chowdhury is a prehealth student who adores art but does not creat much of it except for when it is for school. Even though, I do not create as much art as I would hope to, when I do, I focus on what I find nostalgic (my childhood) and creating art that is healing (for me). My art is also influenced by my religion. My preferred medium is watercolor, oil pastels, or simply pen to paper. I also dabble in design work such as make posters that stand out but stay in theme with what it is promoting. </p>
<p> I focus on making my art as realistic as possible. I am a bit of a perfectionist so I either go all the way with my art or just enough which may make my art seem inconsistent (which it is ;D). My art reflects my mood and the mental state that I am in. It reflects me as a person as I use art as a way to cope. I create art mostly for myself; to keep myself accountable.</p>
