  <h1> Homework #1: Getting started with web </h1>
  <p>This reading began by explaining the difference between HTML and CSS where HTML is used for "meaning", the structure of content, and CSS is used for "presentation", the way the content visually looks. I found it interesting that there are so many ways in which a file can be saved from a text editor and how specialized code-editing softwares could possibly be harmful to a beginner when they first begin learning HTML. I have not coded or used HTML since high school (and CSS since middle school!) so I found it really exciting and nostalgic to be working with these languages again. I find it super incredible that, just by using a few codes, you are able to create a full blown website! For this assignment, I followed the different codes that each website and website pages asked readers to try. I was actually pretty confused on what this assignment wanted us to do and have for our homework 1 html page, so I just added the different codes to this html page that I played around with when I followed the website’s directions. I included all these codes below. I found that this assignment to be extremely healpful as it refreshed my memory on different codes as well as introducing so many new codes to me. The code that I found to be my absolute favorite, and the most helpful code was the br code. I am someone who really likes my documents to be formatted in a specific way, particularly having my document being single spaced, which this code helps to do.
