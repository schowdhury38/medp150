  <h1> You hear a sound... </h1>

  <p> It's the middle of the night and you're peacefully lying on your bed counting sheep, trying to fight off your insomnia. All is going well (more like normal...you fight for sleep every night) when you hear something. No, the sound isn't in your room, but your walls are thin enough to hear the noise outside and it sounds like a kitten's meow. Odd. While it isn't strange for you to hear cats and birds and squirrels make noise outside, you have never heard a kitten before. You think nothing of it...or do you? </p>
