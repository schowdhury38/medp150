   <h3> Homework #2 Reading Reflection: Chapter 1 of "On Photography"</h3>
  <p>Susan Sontag’s On Photography really opened my mind to how often we take taking pictures for granted. It is so easily accessible to us through of phone’s camera lens that I never really stopped to acknowledge the ingenuity of it and just how revolutionary it is (especially when she described the history and emotional reasons behind taking photographs). For me, I have never really liked taking photos especially since my dad always take a million photos of us at every turn, so I found them to be a nuisance plus they take up so much storage on my phone. This has changed in the past year though due to me realizing/being grateful that my parents had so many photos and videos of our family over the years plus documenting the growth of my cat that we rescued when he was barely a week old has helped change my mind! I use photography as a way of documenting my life since I have poor memory; I find that a visual aid helps me remember what was happening at the time of the picture and even my feelings at the time.  <br>
To me, graphics are just like photographs in that they are telling you a specific thing, but graphics have the added benefit of having text and color to more clearly state what it is trying to get across. As for creating graphics, I haven't made many graphics, however I do enjoy making them especially if there is a theme. Most of my experience in creating graphics comes from a volunteering club I was in in high school where I was part of a section of the club where we made posters for the different volunteering events. I found it fun to make graphics that were in line with what the event was about, and I always tried to use colors and fonts that were eye-catching. Nowadays, the graphics I make are usually ones that I use for my journals and I am not really sure that they count as graphics.  <br>
I could visually represent through photography or illustration or the combination of image and text notions of our world at this moment by making a collage of images of natural disasters, world events, and social media comments and posts. I really think incorporating social media in some way would be an interesting way to represent how individuals feel at this moment of the world as well as it also being a huge way in which many changes have been happening. An animation of the conflict between the dystopian of the world continuing while atrocities happened would be a way to visually represent what is happening at this moment in our world. I also think those historical satire illustrations in newspapers (the propaganda comics) would be a really great way to use to describe and show what is happening and people’s thoughts. There are many more ways in which we can represent the world through photography, illustration, or the combination of image and text notions but I can't think of any more for now.  </p>

<h3>Homework #4 Reading Reflection: "With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster" by Nesrine Malik. </h3>
<p>Before reading this article, the title really stood out to me and made me excited to read the article. I am incredibly cautious regarding AI content and usage of AI as it is currently being pushed and promoted to everyday consumers every single day. From YouTube ads depicting Gemini and Google’s different AI features to the normalization of getting AI search results when simply searching on Google, artificial intelligence and the usage of it is promoted left and right. It is also incredibly crazy how AI is integrated into student’s lives through Grammarly (which I did not know was an AI tool until my English teacher last semester mentioned it to us) and the rising concern of the usage of ChatGPT by students for assignments, I am already not a huge fan of AI especially since I have a hard time distinguishing between edited pictures and videos. Adding AI into the mix is just a recipe for disasters, especially since the new AI features allow you to create videos that look astonishingly real. One such video popped up on my mother’s Facebook, and I had such a hard time realizing it was AI until my sister mentioned it to me. That is scary.  
<br>
For this article, the opening image with the broken glasses really hints at what the article will discuss with the broke glasses signifying a distorted reality where we cannot trust what we see due to AI. The author of the article starts the article off by discussing the use of AI in politics (the politicization of AI) and how it is being used as an extension to traditional propaganda. She rightfully points out that the use of AI in this context is quite dangerous as it is not retrained by the constraints of real life which means that any scenario can be created and that there is not real way to verify if what you are viewing is real. She also mentions how people will believe AI content if it is sent to them by someone they trust. This creates the huge possibility of misinformation spreading and really does blur the line between what is true and what is fake. I was also shocked to know that “generative AI is structurally conservative, even nostalgic.” This makes sense since it is using pre-existing content to generate images, but it was still a shock to realize and learn. I was also shocked to learn that it is inherently biased against a whole range of things such as ethnic diversity. Her final point of this media consuming causes a disjunction between reality and the media that is being viewed, and the desensitization of what is happening in reality really cements the possible dangers and very real effects of AI.  </p>

   <h3> Homework #6 Reading Reflection: "Graphic Novel: Motherhood in crisis" by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager and Saidu Bah, Al Jazeera</h3>
  <p>For this reading, I decided to write a reflection on the first story “Chapter 1 Memunatu Birth in my Village.” For all these stories, I believe illustrations were used for many reasons. One reason is that some parts of these stories were not photographed, especially as they were happening. These women were not aware in the moment that these events were happening that it would lead to later events and would later be told and shared to the world. Second, a lot of the events that happened were really emotion events and some intimate moments that would properly be more ethical to show through an illustration rather than through photographs. Finally, some of these events cannot just be expressed through words as words do not really show the truly emotional turmoil that they women faced. Having the motherhood story be told through illustrations, texts, and photographs really helps to engage viewers (not to say that their stories are not worth reading if they were not visually appealing!!) and really catch their attention to this truly heartbreaking story of the lack of proper healthcare that many women face around the world. I also wanted to note that this article was published during 2020 during the height of the pandemic and I remember there being a rise in illustrated artwork being used to depict events happen in the world as well as a rise in the popularity of manga and anime (I recognize the font being used in this story as a very popular font used in manga translations). 
<br>
This motherhood story was so gripping as you can fully see the pain and confusion that Memunatu went through during her stillbirth. You can see the lack of proper care that was given to her during the birth and the total lack of honesty by the herbalist when she gave birth. You can see her emotional turmoil after the birth and her shame for what happened. You see how she finally gets help and the way in which the centre hospital helped her and informed her of what happened and helped treat her. Being able to see the actual photographs of her and the hospital truly helped humanize her and her (and many other women’s) experiences with fistulas. Being able to have the doctor explain what happened was also really informative and really helps to further explain the severity of her situation and what happened to her. Finally, it was really sad to know that the centre was closed after covid came to Sierra Leone. I hope that the centre was able to reopen now since it has been around five years since this article and story was published. </p>

<h3>Homework #10 Reading Reflection: "The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It" by W. J. Hennigan, NY Times</h3>
<p>First, to address the elephant in the room, there graphics and presentation of the article is just immaculate. It at once catches and draws in your attention through the screen having only one sentence “THE RISK OF NUCLEAR CONFLICT IS RISING.” These words are, first, capitalized which puts an emphasis on the statement being made. Second, the background has this gradient where it transitions from red to black with the initial focus being on the area where the words are located. This leads viewers to the statement even if they are not already looking at it or if they have already read the words since this gradient feature leads the viewers eyes naturally to the words. I did find it to be somewhat (very) distracting since it would drag away my attention from what I was reading and I would lose my place which made reading the article slightly more time consuming. I also find the feature to be slight annoying since you had to scroll until the color changed to white to finally get to the article. However, at the end of the feature when it gets to the “the blink” part is really interesting since you see the colors shifting and fade as you scroll to get to the article. It was my favorite part of the feature; to see the shift first made the statement stick in my head while also making it the first thing that I think of when I think back to the article.  
<br>
Finally, on to the actual content of the article, the part of the article where it describes what happens during a nuclear attack was displayed in such an informative and visually gripping way. With each description given, we are then given a visual representation on how the description would play out. Through this, we were given a step-by-step process on what would happen to our environments if an attack were to occur. Then, the part that showed how many nuclear arms countries owned by the year was remarkably interesting! As you scrolled you see how the number of arms increased with each country and it was interesting to see which countries decreased the amount they had exponentially!! Which makes sense due to the Cold War agreements. It was also really informative to have the bar graph at the end to show the total global nuclear stockpile and it was gripping to see how the numbers grew and fell with each year. It was interesting to see that the number of countries that hold nuclear arms increased while the number of total nuclear arms stockpiles decreased. I was not very surprised to see which countries are in possession of these nuclear arms. I found it incredibly informative when the article mentioned current tensions politically that are happening with some of these countries and what they are currently doing with their nuclear arms in relation to these tensions. It really puts in to perspective how real this threat and situation is and the real consequences and devastation that could be looming over the horizon.  </p>
