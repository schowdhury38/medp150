   <h3> Homework #2 Reflection: Cropping and Resizing Images & Tonal Range </h3>
<h5><i> Chapter 1 of "On Photography" </i></h5>
  <p>Susan Sontag’s On Photography really opened my mind to how often we take taking pictures for granted. It is so easily accessible to us through of phone’s camera lens that I never really stopped to acknowledge the ingenuity of it and just how revolutionary it is (especially when she described the history and emotional reasons behind taking photographs). For me, I have never really liked taking photos especially since my dad always take a million photos of us at every turn, so I found them to be a nuisance plus they take up so much storage on my phone. This has changed in the past year though due to me realizing/being grateful that my parents had so many photos and videos of our family over the years plus documenting the growth of my cat that we rescued when he was barely a week old has helped change my mind! I use photography as a way of documenting my life since I have poor memory; I find that a visual aid helps me remember what was happening at the time of the picture and even my feelings at the time.  <br><br>
To me, graphics are just like photographs in that they are telling you a specific thing, but graphics have the added benefit of having text and color to more clearly state what it is trying to get across. As for creating graphics, I haven't made many graphics, however I do enjoy making them especially if there is a theme. Most of my experience in creating graphics comes from a volunteering club I was in in high school where I was part of a section of the club where we made posters for the different volunteering events. I found it fun to make graphics that were in line with what the event was about, and I always tried to use colors and fonts that were eye-catching. Nowadays, the graphics I make are usually ones that I use for my journals and I am not really sure that they count as graphics.  <br><br>
I could visually represent through photography or illustration or the combination of image and text notions of our world at this moment by making a collage of images of natural disasters, world events, and social media comments and posts. I really think incorporating social media in some way would be an interesting way to represent how individuals feel at this moment of the world as well as it also being a huge way in which many changes have been happening. An animation of the conflict between the dystopian of the world continuing while atrocities happened would be a way to visually represent what is happening at this moment in our world. I also think those historical satire illustrations in newspapers (the propaganda comics) would be a really great way to use to describe and show what is happening and people’s thoughts. There are many more ways in which we can represent the world through photography, illustration, or the combination of image and text notions but I can't think of any more for now.  </p>
