   <h3> Homework #2 Reading Reflection:Chapter 1 of "On Photography"</h3>
  <p>Susan Sontag’s On Photography really opened my mind to how often we take taking pictures for granted. It is so easily accessible to us through of phone’s camera lens that I never really stopped to acknowledge the ingenuity of it and just how revolutionary it is (especially when she described the history and emotional reasons behind taking photographs). For me, I have never really liked taking photos especially since my dad always take a million photos of us at every turn, so I found them to be a nuisance plus they take up so much storage on my phone. This has changed in the past year though due to me realizing/being grateful that my parents had so many photos and videos of our family over the years plus documenting the growth of my cat that we rescued when he was barely a week old has helped change my mind! I use photography as a way of documenting my life since I have poor memory; I find that a visual aid helps me remember what was happening at the time of the picture and even my feelings at the time.  <br>
To me, graphics are just like photographs in that they are telling you a specific thing, but graphics have the added benefit of having text and color to more clearly state what it is trying to get across. As for creating graphics, I haven't made many graphics, however I do enjoy making them especially if there is a theme. Most of my experience in creating graphics comes from a volunteering club I was in in high school where I was part of a section of the club where we made posters for the different volunteering events. I found it fun to make graphics that were in line with what the event was about, and I always tried to use colors and fonts that were eye-catching. Nowadays, the graphics I make are usually ones that I use for my journals and I am not really sure that they count as graphics.  <br>
I could visually represent through photography or illustration or the combination of image and text notions of our world at this moment by making a collage of images of natural disasters, world events, and social media comments and posts. I really think incorporating social media in some way would be an interesting way to represent how individuals feel at this moment of the world as well as it also being a huge way in which many changes have been happening. An animation of the conflict between the dystopian of the world continuing while atrocities happened would be a way to visually represent what is happening at this moment in our world. I also think those historical satire illustrations in newspapers (the propaganda comics) would be a really great way to use to describe and show what is happening and people’s thoughts. There are many more ways in which we can represent the world through photography, illustration, or the combination of image and text notions but I can't think of any more for now.  </p>

<h3>Homework #9 Reading Reflection: "The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It" by W. J. Hennigan, NY Times</h3>
<p>First, to address the elephant in the room, there graphics and presentation of the article is just immaculate. It at once catches and draws in your attention through the screen having only one sentence “THE RISK OF NUCLEAR CONFLICT IS RISING.” These words are, first, capitalized which puts an emphasis on the statement being made. Second, the background has this gradient where it transitions from red to black with the initial focus being on the area where the words are located. This leads viewers to the statement even if they are not already looking at it or if they have already read the words since this gradient feature leads the viewers eyes naturally to the words. I did find it to be somewhat (very) distracting since it would drag away my attention from what I was reading and I would lose my place which made reading the article slightly more time consuming. I also find the feature to be slight annoying since you had to scroll until the color changed to white to finally get to the article. However, at the end of the feature when it gets to the “the blink” part is really interesting since you see the colors shifting and fade as you scroll to get to the article. It was my favorite part of the feature; to see the shift first made the statement stick in my head while also making it the first thing that I think of when I think back to the article.  
<br>
Finally, on to the actual content of the article, the part of the article where it describes what happens during a nuclear attack was displayed in such an informative and visually gripping way. With each description given, we are then given a visual representation on how the description would play out. Through this, we were given a step-by-step process on what would happen to our environments if an attack were to occur. Then, the part that showed how many nuclear arms countries owned by the year was remarkably interesting! As you scrolled you see how the number of arms increased with each country and it was interesting to see which countries decreased the amount they had exponentially!! Which makes sense due to the Cold War agreements. It was also really informative to have the bar graph at the end to show the total global nuclear stockpile and it was gripping to see how the numbers grew and fell with each year. It was interesting to see that the number of countries that hold nuclear arms increased while the number of total nuclear arms stockpiles decreased. I was not very surprised to see which countries are in possession of these nuclear arms. I found it incredibly informative when the article mentioned current tensions politically that are happening with some of these countries and what they are currently doing with their nuclear arms in relation to these tensions. It really puts in to perspective how real this threat and situation is and the real consequences and devastation that could be looming over the horizon.  </p>
