  <h3> city outside the bridge edited </h3>
  <img src="images/cityedited.jpg" alt="city image edited" width="300px">
   <p>In the image, you can see the reflection from the glass showing some aspects of the hallway, but mostly showing a reflection of the school on the right side of the image. The image doesn't have this in focus as I wanted it to be kind of like taking a breath of air during a busy day. Looking out the window and seeing this beautiful view, giving yourself space to just breathe. Given this, in my edits, I made the image brighter so that the colors stood out more. I also adjusted the cyan colors to make them softer and increased the blue-red hue such that the brick building and sky would stand out. Since I wanted the building and sky to stand out, I made sure not to adjusted the yellow-green hue so that the school building that is reflected in the window doesn't really pop out unless you are focused on the image. I wanted the scenery to draw viewers attention + make them smile. </p>
